# FFCT
FFCT or False Front Camo Tool is a set of tools that allow a user to import Custom Camos into First Person Shooter "False Front" developed by Svantech Studios
This tool includes:
TEXTURE EXTRACTOR
TEXTURE UNPACKER
TEXTURE REPACKER
This set does not include any sort of Texture Insertion tools. That will need to be done through a Hex Editor (in my case HxD)
