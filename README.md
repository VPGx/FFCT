# FFCT
FFCT, or False Front Camo Tool is a set of tools that allow a user to import Custom Camos into First Person Shooter "False Front" developed by Svantech Studios.
This tool includes a Texture Extractor, XNB Unpacker & XNB Repacker (both made by LeonBlade). This set does not include any sort of Reinsertion tool, that will need to be done through the use of HxD or some other Hex Editor. It can be done simply by rewriting the data of the .XNB file to the Entry Data point in "ContentFile.scc"
You can find the Entry Point of the item inside the generated ID List text file upon extracting your files for the first time.
